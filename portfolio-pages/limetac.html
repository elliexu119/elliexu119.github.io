                <li>The process of developing this product involved field tests in warehouses, reseaches into cameras and their calculations, and problem solving various unexpected issues in the field.</li>

                <p>"Ellie demonstrated exceptional creative problem-solving skills that surprised and impressed me on multiple occasions. When presented with a task, she was always able to quickly come up with a variety of solutions. She displayed this ability throughout the term on the various projects she worked on. Ellie had also demonstrated excellent persistence throughout the term. This was reflected on multiple occasions; she impressed me when she decided that unexpected issues did not mean the end of the project, even if those issues were large enough to halt it. Overall, Ellie showed an excellent ability to creatively solve any problems she was faced with and carried with her the persistence to follow through with a task despite the obstacles."</p>
